# MTA Audio Editor 0.2.0-12

## Python 3.14 and Kubernetes/Kustomize release

This release supersedes the two previously open Dependabot proposals by adopting the Python 3.14 container baseline and the compatible dependency set instead of suppressing those updates.

- Production and CI baseline: `python:3.14-slim-bookworm`.
- NumPy updated to 2.5.3.
- Demucs remains 4.1.0 and the production image validates the Python 3.14 stem stack.
- The Docker and Python dependency PR intents are therefore incorporated into mainline package contents.
- Gitleaks pull-request scanning keeps full Git history.


## GitHub Actions reliability fix

The Python 3.14 baseline remains enabled. The Quality job exposed an intermittent resolver failure for `pydantic==2.13.5`, which requires `pydantic-core==2.46.5`. The Security job in the same workflow could resolve it while the Quality job could not. This release pins `pydantic==2.12.5`, whose `pydantic-core==2.41.5` dependency has established CPython 3.14 wheels, and prevents Dependabot from immediately reopening the unstable 2.13/2.14 upgrade.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes resources are now split under `k8s/base` into Namespace, PVC, Deployment and Service, with an example Secret kept outside the default Kustomization. NGINX and HAProxy Ingress examples are supplied as independent Kustomize overlays.

A new `scripts/k8s-wizard.py` is downloadable directly from the GitHub raw URL and uses only the Python standard library. It asks for initial administrator username/password, PVC StorageClass, namespace and nodeSelector, remembers the last values in a mode-0600 configuration file, can optionally generate NGINX/HAProxy Ingress, and creates a local Kustomization. On startup it checks GitHub for a strictly newer wizard version; after an atomic self-update it automatically restarts itself.

The generated `secret.yaml` contains local credentials and must not be committed. Use `--no-save-password` when password persistence is not wanted.
